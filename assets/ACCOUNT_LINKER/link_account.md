# How to get automatic Overwatch Roles

## Making your Profile Public

Before you start using the Bot, you need to make sure your profile is public so the Bot can get your Stats.
You can do this by opening Overwatch, going to your Settings, finding the "Social" Tab, and then setting the "Career Profile Visibility" setting to "Public".
I attached an example Screenshot.

**NOTE:** It can take up to an hour for the Overwatch Servers to know you set your profile to public. I can't do anything about this.

## Telling the Bot who you are

1. Select the Platform you play on from the first Dropdown
2. Select the Region Server you connect to from the second one
3. Press the Button
4. Enter your name in the Popup window (With #, numbers, and correct capitalization)
5. Press the Popup windows button to confirm

# What are the automatic Overwatch Roles?

These are Roles that the Bot gives you based on your Stats. For now, this is limited to which Heros you play and which one you main.
But I plan on adding stuff like Rank, preferred Role, etc.
